## Summary {-} 
<!-- the {-} means don't number this section -->
- benefit of looking at growth rates
- maps provide cluster info and spatial context
- this idea can be extended, but needs modifications for non-metro areas 
- available on a website

# Introduction

- covid-19
- covid-19 visualizations
- nyt inspiration



# Growth Rate Visualizations

- intro with more details on the nyt article inspiration

## Daily Growth Rate over Time

- plot
- interactivity 
- pros/cons
- add some example findings

## Daily Growth Rate by Case Count

- plot
- pros/cons
- add some example findings



# Maps of Metro Areas

## Map of Confirmed Cases per 1,000 People

- plot
- pros/cons
- add some example findings

## Map of Confirmed Deaths per 1,000 People

- plot
- pros/cons
- add some example findings



# Follow-up work

## Unemployment and Confirmed COVID-19 Cases

- talk about the Reka conversation 
- additional plots

## COVID-19 Spread in Counties With Few Cases

- talk about the Gundersen conversation
- additional plots for them, why they needed to be different

## Future work
